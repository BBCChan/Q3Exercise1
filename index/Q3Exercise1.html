He often tries to help Dora on her adventures, but Benny is so accident-prone that it is usually him that is in need of Dora’s help. Benny lives in a large red barn with his grandmother. Dora often goes there to visit him. Benny is a skilled dancer and loves fiesta food, especially cake and ice cream. He’s also Tico's best friend.</p></div></td>
